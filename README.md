1. **Determination of a promising tariff for a telecom company**</sub>. Customers of Megaline, a federal mobile operator, are offered two tariff plans: Smart and Ultra. In order to adjust the advertising budget, the commercial department wants to understand which tariff brings the most money. A preliminary analysis of tariffs was made for a small sample of customers - data from 500 Megaline users: who they are, where they are from, what tariff they use, how many calls and messages each sent in 2018. The behavior of customers was analyzed and a conclusion was made - which tariff is better.
